                        rental price does not include the professional skipper in case the boat is also available for
                        charter without skipper. In this case the price of the professional skipper will be an

                        proves to have the minimum qualifications required for the boat booked, it will require an
                        amount as a deposit, defined in the tab of each boat, the customer will have to give in cash or
                        by credit card upon delivery of the boat and RENT ME BOAT paid in full after the return and
                        verification that the boat is as in the same state as before delivery (approx 24h

                        hours you have consumed or you can refuel it yourself at the gas station in the
                        port.<br><br><br>6. SKIPPER<br>In the specifications of each boat is defined the
