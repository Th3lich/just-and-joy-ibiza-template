                        safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet
                        or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or

                        defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although

                        information to and from our website is at your own risk. You should only access the website

                        details&nbsp;provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with

                        this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect

                        include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
                        preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
                        this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
                        finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
                        that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
                        tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
                        a revised version of this privacy notice.<br><br>10.&nbsp;DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC
